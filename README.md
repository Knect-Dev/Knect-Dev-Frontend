<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[Deployed Page](https://www.knect.dev/home)
<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->

This repository implements phase two (frontend) of a two phase project (full web application deployment).

The goal of this project is to create a Targeted Companies & High-Volume Tracking List that allows those seeking jobs to effectively document the jobs they have applied for as well as thier most up to date interactions. Phase one, the backend of this project, focused on building and deploying a reliable backend with robust schemas and database models. Phase two, the frontend portion, focused on building a user-friendly interface in React with and Ionic framework to streamline data input as well as visualize metrics in real time of your job search.

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Knect-Dev/Knect-Dev-Backend.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install i
   ```
3. Enter your API in `.env`
   ```js
    PORT = 3000
    API_KEY = 'ENTER YOUR API';
    SECRET = 'YOUR SECRET';
   
   ```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

1. Create a new user account or sign in to an existing account.

2. Upon signing in for the first time, the Jobs list will be blank, so click on the green (+) button in the upper right corner to open up the form for adding a new Job opportunity to your collection.

3. In the form that pops up, click the padlock icon in the bottom left corner to unlock the form for and begin editing.

4. `Job Title` and `Company` are required fields; all others are optional.

5. To add or change the company, type part of `search companies` to see if the company already exists in the database.

## Data Models
This project utilized dynamoose and DynamoDB and the following data models...
* Users, contains all information for the user (essentially a user profile), this is created at /signup, and the id and email must be unique for each user.
* Jobs, these objects contain information about a specific job position at a company and are owned by the user who creates it
* Companies, these objects provide general company information, anyone can create one, and update it with the most recent information. The thought process here is that there is only one company ever created, and can be updated for everyone with the most information.

### User Model
``` Javascript
'Users' {
  id: PRIMARY KEY, required,
  name: STRING, required,
  password: STRING, required,
  token: STRING, required,

## Data Associations and User Experience

We decided early on that we wanted to use a relational database model for a few reasons:
1. We wanted our Users to have a unique user experience, and allow them to create Jobs that were unique to them
  - We did this by setting UserId within the Job record on creation, establishing a One-to-Many association between Users and Jobs. 
  - Upon logging in, the User's unique jobs will render to the screen.
2. We also wanted our Companies to be community based, meaning a Company is created once, then edited by all
  - Companies also have a unique id, and Job records utilize this when created or edited, and create an association within the database.
  - When a change is made to a company by a User, the database is updated and the new info is propogated to all other Users.
3. The Jobs are the crux of the application, in functionality as well as associations
  - Jobs, as mentioned before, contain both a UserId and a CompanyId which establish associations between all three models.
  - These associations are then used to conditionally render the Company associated to the job, and the Contacts related to both the Job and the Company
4. Lastly, Contacts are related to all three of the previous models
  - The Contacts are rendered based on UserId, JobId, and CompanyId.
